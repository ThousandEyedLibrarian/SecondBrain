Treats groups of agents as one large agent with many degrees of freedom, extrapolates decision space out from there.

Complete and optimal but scales poorly and is often a non-starter.

Branching factor is $b|A|$. On 4-C gridmaps ([[Discretising An Environment For AI Models]]) we have $b = 5$.
- 2 agents = 52 successors (= 25; acceptable)
- 3 agents = 53 successors (=125; challenging)
-  5 agents = 55 successors (=3125; unreasonable)
