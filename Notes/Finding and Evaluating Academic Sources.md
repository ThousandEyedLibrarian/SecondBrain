## Getting Started with Literature Reviews

Academic [[Research]] typically begins with a few papers recommended by supervisors or colleagues. From this starting point, a systematic expansion is needed.

## Building a Synthesis Matrix

A synthesis matrix facilitates understanding of multiple sources rather than describing them individually. This comparison table enables:

- Comparison and contrast of different approaches
- Pattern and difference identification
- Key insight extraction

**Important note:** Matrix columns should reflect actual concepts being explored, not paper section headings.

## Finding More Relevant Papers

### Two Key Strategies:
1. **Mining References** (Backward Search)
    - Literature review sections should be scanned in initial papers
    - Abstracts of cited papers can be checked via Google Scholar
    - Most relevant papers are selected for deeper reading
2. **Tracking Citations** (Forward Search)
    - Google Scholar identifies papers citing the starting papers
    - Abstract assessment determines relevance
    - Newer research building on the topic is discovered

**Time management:** Approximately 10 minutes per search type prevents excessive time investment.

## Evaluating Source Quality

### Three Key Indicators:

**1. Venue**

- Publication location matters
- Journal or conference reputation requires checking
- Peer-reviewed venues are preferable

**2. Citations**

- Citation count indicates impact
- Citation sources and venues provide context
- Google Scholar or Scopus facilitate checking

**3. Authors**

- Track record in the area is significant
- Established researchers indicate credibility
- Other publications reveal expertise

## Practical Tips

- Initial focus should be on abstracts, introductions, and conclusions
- Core contributions and main approaches require identification
- Experiment design sections reveal validation methods
- Specific research questions guide relevance assessment

Note: Complete understanding of every paper detail isn't necessary. Relevance to the specific research area and field overview are the priorities.
