Convoluted surface of [[Cerebrum]], about 1/8th of an inch thick.

Six layers of [[Neuron]]s and relatively uniform in structure across areas (hard to find differences between areas).

Suggestion has been made that there is a common computational principle operating across the cortex but this hasn't been proven yet.

## Primary Sensory Cortex 

Divided into regions like the visual, auditory and somatosensory cortexes which all get direct input from the [[Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGM)]].

Organised via maps!

Generally considered the area of greatest interest in [[Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)]] research because it is most accessible to electrode probes and scalp recording.
