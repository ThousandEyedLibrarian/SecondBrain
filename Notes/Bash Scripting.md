Firstly, always add `set -euo pipefail` to the beginning of your script after `#! /usr/bin/env/bash` for better script behaviour.

## Quick Start
1. Write your script sans `.sh` extension
2. Chuck it in `usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin`
	1. Really anywhere as long as that directory is in your `$PATH` environment  variable
3. Have fun, you can use the script as a terminal command now

Note: If the script is local to a project, save it with the .sh extension and keep it in the project directory.
