A common [[Neurodegenerative Illness]] characterised by recurrent [[Seizure]]s, the unpredictability of which is an enormous issue for sufferers of the disorder.

Recent efforts have been made into reviewing predictability of these seizures, and accelerated studies into same.

## Current State of Epilepsy Research

- One clinical trial has shown that prospective seizure prediction in humans is possible
- Databases of [[Electroencephalography (EEG)]] data provide a good standard reference for comparison of prediction algorithms
- Competitions are being run re prediction algorithms
- The network theory of epilepsy, multimodal recording techniques, longer monitoring periods and computational modelling are allowing new approaches to prediction
- Large-scale clinical trials seem to be ready for implementation
