Myelin due to [[Glial Cells]], wrap [[Axon]]s and enable fast long-range [[Action Potential (AP)]] (spike) communication.

It allows the AP to 'hop' from one non-myelinated region to another via something called saliatory conduction.

This allows *lossless signal propagation*, crazy! That is why [[Multiple Sclerosis (MS)]] degrading the myelin on your axons causes various symptoms, all stemming from the inability to properly propagate neural signals.
