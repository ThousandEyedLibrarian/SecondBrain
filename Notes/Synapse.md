The junction point of [[Neuron]]s, can be electrical or chemical.

## Electrical Synapses

Function similarly to electrical component connections, activity from neuron A can propagate to neuron B via voltage changes, happens across a gap junction.

A gap junction is basically shared ion channels across two neurons membrances, good for fast connections across neurons, traditionally found when neurons need to synchronise (fire together).

## Chemical Synapses

Transference of vesicles ([[Neurotransmitter]]) across a synaptic cleft to fuse with the chemically gated ionic channels of another neuron.

Allows you to change the way neuron B is affected by the same spike by changing the number of ionic channels opened (the neurotransmitters can bind to and close channels etc.).

*Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory, increase or decrease postsynaptic membrane potential.*

### Excitatory Synapse Flow

## Synaptic Plasticity

Hebbian Plasticity: "If neuron A repeatedly takes part in firing neuron B, then the synapse from A to B is strengthened."

"*Neurons that fire together, wire together!*"

Recently found to depend on spike timing, whether you get LTP or LTD depends on the relative timing of input and output spikes. If the input spike is before the output spike from A to B, the potential of B will be greater, showing LTP. Vice versa if the input spike is after the output spike, i.e. B fires then A due to input from other neurons, that's LTD. This is called Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP).

### Long Term Potentiation (LTP)

Experimentally observed increase in synaptic strength that lasts for hours or days, demonstrated by viewing the potential of a given neuron B upon excitation of a given neuron A.

### Long Term Depression (LTD)

As above but a decrease.
