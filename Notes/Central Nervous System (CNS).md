Comprised of the [[Brain]] and [[Spinal Cord]], the CNS integrates multiple sensory inputs to produce appropriate motor outputs.

## Spinal Cord

Local feedback loops control reflexes from the spinal cord, these are called reflex arcs, e.g. pulling your hand away from a hot surface.

Descending motor control signals from the brain activate spinal motor neurons without conscious brain commands.
