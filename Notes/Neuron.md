"A leaky bag of charged liquid".

Within a cell membrane (a lipid bilayer) the contents are stored, this bilayer is impermeable to charged [[Ion]]s. Ionic channels are embedded in it to allow ions to flow in or out.

Each neuron maintains an electric potential difference between the outside and inside of the membrane. About -70 mV relative to outside. Due to higher concentrations of positive or negatively charged ions on outside vs inside. There is also an ionic pump that expels sodium ions out and allows potassium ions in.

### So how do we influence a neurons personality?

The ionic channels. They're gated according to one of three things:
1. Membrane voltage
2. Binding of a chemical
3. Mechanism (pressure or stretch)

When the channels open we get a change in the local membrane potential, e.g. we get a chemical gate open from input from other neurons which allows in positive sodium ions or something, this in turn causes voltage gated channels in the membrane to open which can cause polarization (positive volt. change) or hyperpolarization (negative volt. change), strong enough depol. causes an [[Action Potential (AP)]].
