Systematically exploring tree-like structures to find what you're after. 

Whether it's pathfinding in games, solving puzzles, or parsing [[Decision Trees]], you're fundamentally traversing [[Node]]s and edges until you hit your target state.

Examples:
1. [[Breadth-First Traversal]]
2. [[Depth-First Traversal]]
3. [[A-Star Search]] (A variant of A* is normally optimal for most problem spaces)
