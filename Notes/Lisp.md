Lisp (LISt Processing) is a small family of unique programming languages mainly characterised by s-expressions, homoiconicity, and functional programming paradigms.

## Core Features

- [[S-Expressions]]: Uniform syntax using nested [[Array Lists]]
- Homoiconicity: Code and data have identical structure
- [[Dynamic Typing]]: Types determined at runtime
- Garbage collection: Automatic memory management
- First-class [[Functions]]: Functions as values
- Macros: Code generation and transformation
