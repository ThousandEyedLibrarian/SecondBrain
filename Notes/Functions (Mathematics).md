## Functions as [[Vectors]]

It is often possible to describe a function in terms of a vector of numbers, e.g. $x/2$ below and the corresponding vector.

### Performing Vector Operations with Functions

1. Sum = [[Integral]] = "Area under the curve of a given function to 0 y"
	1. Integral is the function version of a sum
2. Dot Product = Projection = "Integral of the element-wise products"

Example of the dot product of two funcs. (aka the projection of one func onto another):

If two funcs don't overlap *at all*, the dot product will be 0! Note the below example is just a sketch, assume the areas are the same.
