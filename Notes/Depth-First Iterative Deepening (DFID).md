Depth-First Iterative Deepening (DFID) combines the space efficiency of [[Depth-First Traversal]] with the optimality guarantees of [[Breadth-First Traversal]]. The algorithm performs a series of depth-limited searches with progressively increasing depth limits.

***Put simply, hit the first $x$ levels with breadth-first first, then increase it $x$ by one and restart, repeat until the goal state it found.***

## Algorithm Operation

1. **Initial Phase**: A depth-limited search begins with depth limit 0
2. **Iterative Process**: The depth limit increases by 1 in each subsequent iteration
3. **Termination**: The process continues until the goal state is found or the search space is exhausted

## Key Characteristics

**Space Complexity**: O(d) where d represents the depth of the solution 
**Time Complexity**: O(b^d) where b represents the branching factor 
**Completeness**: Guaranteed to find a solution if one exists 
**Optimality**: Finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs

*Note*: The branching factor (b) refers to the average number of child [[Node]]s that each node has in a search [[Trees]] or [[Graphs]]. In the context of depth-first iterative deepening.

## Advantages

- **Memory Efficient**: Requires minimal storage compared to breadth-first search
- **Optimal Solutions**: Discovers the shallowest goal state first
- **Practical Implementation**: Easier to implement than bidirectional search

## Disadvantages

- **Redundant Computation**: States near the root are expanded multiple times
- **Overhead**: Each iteration repeats work from previous iterations
- **Performance Cost**: Generally slower than pure breadth-first search

## Applications

DFID proves particularly valuable in scenarios where:

- [[Memory]] constraints limit the feasibility of breadth-first search
- The solution depth remains unknown
- Optimal path length is required
- Search spaces contain large branching factors

## Performance Analysis

The algorithm's [[Asymptotic Complexity]] matches that of breadth-first search despite the repeated expansions. The redundant work becomes negligible as the search depth increases, since most nodes exist at the deepest levels of the search tree.
