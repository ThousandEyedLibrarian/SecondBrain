A band-pass filter or bandpass filter (BPF) is a device that passes [frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") within a certain range and rejects ([attenuates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuate "Attenuate")) frequencies outside that range. It is the inverse of a [[Band-stop Filter (BSF)]].
