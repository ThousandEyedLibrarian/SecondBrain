## Descriptive Models


## Mechanistic Models

How are things put together? E.g. how are [[Receptive Field (RF) (Brain)]] constructed using neural circuitry of the visual cortex? How are these oriented receptive fields obtained from centre-surround receptive fields?
## Interpretive Models

Why is something the way it is? E.g. why are receptive fields in V1 cells shaped the way they are? What are the computational advantages of such receptive fields?
