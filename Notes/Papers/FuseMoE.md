This research tackles a practical problem in machine learning: how to combine different types of data (like text, images, and time series) when some data might be missing and collected at irregular intervals. The authors develop **FuseMoE**, which uses a mixture-of-experts architecture—a [[Neural Networks (NN)]] that routes different inputs to specialised sub-networks called "experts." Their key technical contribution is replacing the standard softmax gating function with a **Laplace gating function** that measures similarity using Euclidean distance ($−∥W−x∥2−∥W−x∥2​$) rather than dot products. This prevents certain experts from dominating and handles diverse input types more fairly. The system includes three router designs: joint routing (all modalities together), per-modality routing (separate routing for each data type), and disjoint routing (separate expert pools per modality). It also uses discretised multi-time attention (mTAND) to convert irregularly sampled time series into fixed-length representations, and handles missing modalities by routing them to underutilised experts through entropy regularisation.

The authors provide theoretical guarantees proving that Laplace gating achieves $O(n−1/4)O(n−1/4)$ convergence rates for expert parameters compared to slower rates for softmax gating, particularly in over-parameterised settings. Testing on real datasets—including MIMIC-IV hospital records with vital signs, clinical notes, chest X-rays, and ECGs—shows consistent improvements across prediction tasks. Their complete multimodal system achieved 0.75 AUC compared to 0.71 for single-modality approaches on [[Epilepsy]] medication prediction, and outperformed baselines on mortality prediction (81.03 vs 79.65 AUC) and sentiment analysis tasks. The practical impact is significant for healthcare applications where patient data is often incomplete: the system can still make good predictions when some types of medical data are missing (improving performance even with 40% missing modalities), and it handles the reality that different measurements are taken at different times rather than requiring perfectly synchronised data collection.
