**MoLeR** by Maziarz et al. (2022) introduces a **Graph Neural Network architecture** for molecular scaffold extension that automatically discovers 128 common structural motifs and generates molecules through hybrid atom/motif addition. The model achieves **>99% molecular validity** and **>97% novelty** while training 10x faster than comparable approaches.

The **technical architecture** employs tf2-gnn based encoder-decoder framework with 512-dimensional molecular embeddings. The encoder uses RGCN variants with 2-16 message passing layers, while the decoder performs multi-task learning combining graph reconstruction with molecular property prediction. **Motif-based generation** enables scaffold-constrained molecular design that mimics medicinal chemistry workflows.

**SMILES embedding capabilities** produce high-quality molecular representations through automatic motif decomposition and graph encoding. The embeddings capture both local structural features and global molecular properties, enabling **cosine similarity between embeddings to reflect chemical similarity**. Reconstruction accuracy reaches ~3% exact matches (improvable to >20% with hyperparameter tuning).

For **epilepsy drug discovery applications**, MoLeR embeddings can analyse anti-epileptic drug scaffolds, predict blood-brain barrier permeability, and identify structurally similar compounds to known effective treatments. The **scaffold extension capability** enables generation of novel molecular variants optimised for multiple epilepsy-relevant properties including CNS activity and metabolic stability.
