**De Jong et al. (2021)** demonstrates the first successful integration of genomic data with machine learning for epilepsy drug response prediction, achieving **AUC 0.76** across discovery and validation cohorts. Their hybrid approach combines data-driven methods for high-dimensional genomic analysis with knowledge-driven feature selection based on epilepsy pathophysiology.

The technical innovation centres on **mechanistically-relevant feature extraction** that reduces ~20 million genomic variants to 40 interpretable features across four modalities: gene set mutational load scores, polygenic risk scores, SV2A variants (drug target-specific), and clinical variables. This knowledge-based dimensionality reduction addresses the curse of dimensionality while maintaining biological relevance.

**Machine learning methodology** employed logistic regression, random forest, and SVM approaches, with ensemble methods showing superior performance. Deep learning approaches failed due to unfavourable feature-to-sample ratios (n=235 discovery cohort), highlighting the importance of appropriate model selection for genomic applications with limited sample sizes.

The framework's **clinical translation potential** is demonstrated through its ability to predict brivaracetam response with statistical significance (P = 0.0000019), suggesting **40-50% reduction in clinical trial sizes** through patient stratification. For multimodal epilepsy prediction, this establishes the methodological foundation for incorporating genomic information alongside EEG, imaging, and clinical data to optimise individual treatment selection.
