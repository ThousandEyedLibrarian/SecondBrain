This research tackles the critical challenge of predicting whether anti-seizure medications (ASMs) will successfully control seizures in newly diagnosed epilepsy patients, moving beyond the current trial-and-error approach that affects one-third of patients who don't respond to initial treatments. The authors developed a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates four key data sources: [[Electroencephalography (EEG)]] recordings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, clinical factors, and molecular drug features. 

The core technical innovation is EEG Q-Net, a pre-trained quantisation model based on the wav2vec 2.0 architecture ([[wav2vec 2.0 - a framework for self-supervised learning of speech representations]]) that uses product quantisation to map continuous EEG signals into discrete [[Neural Codebook (NC)]]s ([[EEGFormer - Towards Transferable and Interpretable Large-Scale EEG Foundation Model]]), addressing the challenge of infinite variability across patients and devices. For drug representation, they employed SMILES [[Embeddings]] (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) rather than traditional [[One-Hot Encoding]], using pre-trained models like MoLER ([[Learning to Extend Molecular Scaffolds with Structural Motifs]]) and Molecular [[Transformer]] Embeddings to capture chemical structures and relationships between medications. The MRI component leverages BiomedCLIP, a vision-language foundation model, to extract 512-dimensional features from multi-view [[Brain]] scans (axial, coronal, and sagittal planes).

The researchers validated their approach using data from 357 patients across two datasets: the Human Epilepsy Project (international multicentre study) and Alfred Health Hospital in Australia, with 85 seizure-free and 272 treatment-failure cases. Through 5-fold cross-validation, their multimodal fusion model achieved an AUC of 0.75, representing a meaningful improvement over the best single-modality approach (clinical factors alone: AUC 0.71). The SMILES molecular embeddings consistently outperformed traditional one-hot drug encoding (0.71 vs 0.68 AUC), demonstrating that capturing chemical structure relationships enhances prediction accuracy. Whilst individual EEG (AUC 0.64) and MRI (AUC 0.69) models showed modest performance alone, their integration with clinical data provided complementary insights that boosted overall prediction capability. The practical significance lies in using routinely collected clinical data—EEG recordings, MRI scans, and standard clinical assessments—making this approach readily translatable to clinical practice for personalised epilepsy management, potentially reducing the time patients spend on ineffective medications and improving quality of life outcomes.
