**MTE** by Morris et al. (2020) adapts Transformer architecture for molecular representation learning through **SMILES-to-IUPAC translation** pre-training on 83+ million molecules. The model reduces standard Transformer size to **12M parameters** (4 layers of size 256) while maintaining effectiveness for binding affinity prediction tasks.

**Molecular tokenisation** processes SMILES strings character-by-character with multi-head attention capturing relationships between molecular substructures. The **transfer learning framework** demonstrates superior AUC performance compared to untrained embeddings, showing effective knowledge transfer from large-scale chemical data to specific binding prediction tasks.

The **embedding generation process** produces configurable-dimensional vectors for each SMILES character, creating MxN matrices (sequence length Ã— embedding dimension) that capture molecular structural characteristics. **Public availability** through GitHub repository enables widespread adoption with embed.py script supporting custom molecular datasets.

**Integration with epilepsy prediction** occurs through molecular feature representation for antiepileptic drug candidates, enabling structure-activity relationship analysis and drug repurposing screening. The embeddings support **chemical space navigation** for novel epilepsy treatments and can identify molecular signatures associated with treatment efficacy in personalised medicine applications.
