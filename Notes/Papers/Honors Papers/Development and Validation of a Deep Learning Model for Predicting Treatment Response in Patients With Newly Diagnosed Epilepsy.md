This study addresses the longstanding challenge that antiseizure medication (ASM) selection for newly diagnosed [[Epilepsy]] remains largely a trial-and-error approach, forcing many patients to endure sequential trials of ineffective treatments. The authors developed a [[Transformer]]-based [[Deep Learning]] model using routinely collected clinical data to predict treatment success with the first prescribed ASM for individual patients. The transformer architecture—traditionally used in natural language processing—was adapted to handle patient data through its multihead attention mechanism, which can focus on different parts of patient information for predicting responses to specific drugs. Drawing from 5 longitudinal cohorts across Scotland, Malaysia, Australia, and China, the model incorporated 16 clinical factors including demographic characteristics, medical history, seizure frequency, EEG findings, and brain imaging results without requiring additional genomic or raw neuroimaging data. The approach represents a significant departure from traditional statistical methods by using attention-based deep learning to mine hidden correlations between patient characteristics and treatment outcomes.

The model was trained and validated on 1,798 adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy, achieving an AUROC of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.63-0.67) and weighted balanced accuracy of 0.62 when trained on pooled data. External validation across different healthcare settings showed AUROCs ranging from 0.52 to 0.60, indicating reasonable but reduced performance in new populations. The transformer model outperformed traditional machine learning approaches including extreme gradient boosting and random forest algorithms. Key predictive factors identified through SHAP analysis included number of pretreatment seizures (>5), presence of psychiatric disorders, and EEG/imaging abnormalities—findings consistent with prior clinical knowledge, supporting the model's internal validity. While the current performance is modest compared to expert clinical judgement (approximately two-thirds of patients currently achieve seizure control through traditional approaches), this work demonstrates the feasibility of personalised ASM selection and establishes a foundation for incorporating additional data modalities such as genetic markers and quantitative neuroimaging to enhance clinical applicability.
