This paper tackles the computational complexity and implementation difficulty of state space models (SSMs) in [[Deep Learning]], specifically addressing limitations of the breakthrough S4 model. 

>S4 is a sequence modelling architecture based on **state space models (SSMs)**, which are fundamental mathematical systems used in control theory and other scientific fields. 
>
>The core SSM is defined by the equations:
>	$x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)$  (continuous state evolution)
>	$y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$   (output projection)
>
>S4 adapts these classical systems for deep learning, creating a single principled model that can handle sequence data across different modalities and tasks.

While S4 demonstrated exceptional performance on long-range dependency tasks using a sophisticated HiPPO matrix parameterised as diagonal-plus-low-rank (DPLR), its implementation requires complex linear algebraic [[Algorithms]] that are challenging to understand and deploy. The authors systematically investigate **diagonal state space models (diagonal SSMs)**, which restrict the state matrix to be fully diagonal, dramatically simplifying computation whilst maintaining performance. Their key technical contribution is **S4D**, which combines optimal parameterisation choices with theoretically principled initialisation strategies. The diagonal structure enables trivial kernel computation through Vandermonde matrix multiplication—reducible to just 2 lines of code—with identical computational complexity to S4 but vastly improved interpretability. They propose three initialization methods: S4D-LegS (diagonal approximation of HiPPO), S4D-Inv (inverse scaling law), and S4D-Lin (linear Fourier frequencies), each targeting different mathematical interpretations of basis functions for sequence modeling.

The theoretical analysis provides crucial insights into why diagonal approximations work, proving that the diagonal restriction of S4's HiPPO matrix surprisingly recovers the same convolution kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension (Theorem 3). Comprehensive empirical validation across image (Sequential CIFAR), audio (Speech Commands), and medical time-series (BIDMC) datasets demonstrates that S4D variants achieve competitive performance with S4 whilst requiring significantly less implementation complexity. On the Long Range Arena benchmark—the standard evaluation for long-sequence models—S4D achieves 85% average accuracy, comparable to S4 and substantially outperforming traditional architectures like [[Transformer]]s (53.66%). The practical impact is substantial: S4D maintains S4's advantages for long-range dependencies whilst being dramatically easier to implement and understand, making state space models more accessible to practitioners. This work bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and practical deployment, offering a simplified yet principled approach to sequence modelling that could accelerate adoption of SSMs in real-world applications requiring efficient processing of long sequences.
